# Real Time Covid-19 Tracker

Our assignment for this project was to utilize CSS, HTML, JavaScript, API calls and JQuery to develop a working application on a topic of our choice from scratch. As a team we conceived and executed a design around the global pandemic of Covid-19. We used API's to integrate data and provide users with useful Covid-19 data. This was also a test of our ability to utilize GitHub and agile development methodologies to be collaborative and be able to work together in implementing features and fix bugs in the branches. 

Our application is a real time tracker utilizing the most up to date Covid-19 data we could find in order to provide users with the states currently reporting the most new cases as well as additional data about any state they search. We also provided three other pages full of useful data and resources for users. The CDC Updates page allows users to get the newest information available from the CDC without navigating away from our site. The Symptoms page provides users a test to take in order to assess any sympotms they may currently be experiencing (though we recomend that anyone with any level of concern seek medical attention and not rely on our test). The final page is a helpful links tab that shares several timely articles on subjects relevant to the pandemic.

User Story:

  AS A concerned citizen
  I WANT to track covid cases near myself and my family
  SO THAT I know how at risk we are
  
Acceptance Criteria:

  WHEN the page loads
  THEN the landing page displays the worst ten states statistics
  WHEN I click one of the states I see more statistics on that state
  OR IF I search a new state I see statistics on that state
  STATISTICS shown are total cases, new cases, total deaths, new deaths, and *maybe testing centers* etc
  WHEN I navigate to the HELP page 
  THEN I see a form to check my symptoms 
  IF I check enough then it recommends I seek medical advice
 

CSS Frameworks Used:
  Pure CSS
